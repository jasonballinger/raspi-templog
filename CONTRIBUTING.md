# Steps for Contributors
These are the steps that should be taken by contributors to help build a better community around this code.
## Issues
Issues are a great way to address something wrong with the code or something that you would like added to the code.
We have templates put in place for issues (bug reports and feature requests), so please don't create any other issues unless you feel that they are absolutely necessary.
## Pull Requests
If you feel that an issue isn't enough, some choose to take the step of making a pull request and making the changes themselves.
This helps me immensely, because I am able to just grant the change and it is much easier to get things done if something breaks.
Pull Requests are preferred, but Issues are fine as well.
## General Rules
Obviously, when contributing, there should be no negative conversation between contributors. When contributing or communicating with others that are making changes to the repository, please make sure to exclude harrasment and bullying from your conversations.
